# 09 — Repoint Flux at the real GitHub orgs and retire the in-cluster git-server

Type: task
Status: open

## Question

Today the clusters reconcile from an in-cluster `git-server` (busybox-httpd smart-HTTP CGI) seeded
from the local tree, while the Flux YAML *declares* URLs like
`https://github.com/policy-as-versioned-driftwood/driftwood` that do not resolve. Make the declared
URLs the real ones.

Includes: repointing every `GitRepository` at the real org repos, credentials/deploy keys for private
repos if any are private, removing the git-server deployment and its seeding path from
`estate/driftwood/scripts/up.sh`, and confirming each cluster reconciles from GitHub with a real
signed tag.

Internet is now assumed, so no mirror and no offline fallback — but check what breaks in `up.sh`'s
`timeout`-bounded steps when they now depend on network, and make the failure mode legible rather
than a hang.

Prove it: `kubectl get gitrepositories -A` showing real GitHub URLs and `READY=True` on all three
clusters, plus a reconcile from a freshly pushed signed tag.
